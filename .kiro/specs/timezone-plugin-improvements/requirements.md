# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines requirements for improving the existing UserMessagesTimezones plugin to make it more professional, robust, and user-friendly. The current plugin is well-structured but has several areas that could be enhanced for better user experience, performance, and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Timezone Selection Experience

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want an intuitive and comprehensive timezone selection interface, so that I can easily find and set my timezone without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the timezone selection menu THEN the system SHALL display a search/filter input field
2. WHEN a user types in the search field THEN the system SHALL filter timezones by city name, country, or timezone identifier
3. WHEN displaying timezone options THEN the system SHALL show the current time for each timezone alongside the name
4. WHEN a user hovers over a timezone option THEN the system SHALL display additional information like UTC offset and region
5. IF a user's system timezone can be detected THEN the system SHALL suggest it as the default option
6. WHEN displaying timezone names THEN the system SHALL use user-friendly city names instead of technical IANA identifiers

### Requirement 2: Improved Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want clear feedback when timezone operations succeed or fail, so that I understand what happened and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a timezone operation fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN a timezone is successfully set THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation notification
3. WHEN the plugin encounters data corruption THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery and log the issue
4. IF timezone data fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide a retry mechanism
5. WHEN network or storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality
6. WHEN displaying error messages THEN the system SHALL avoid technical jargon and provide actionable guidance

### Requirement 3: Performance Optimization and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want the timezone plugin to run efficiently without impacting Discord's performance, so that my chat experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple messages are displayed THEN the system SHALL batch timezone lookups to minimize data manager calls
2. WHEN time updates occur THEN the system SHALL use a single global timer instead of individual component timers
3. WHEN components unmount THEN the system SHALL properly cleanup all resources and listeners
4. WHEN the cache grows large THEN the system SHALL implement cache size limits and cleanup strategies
5. IF timezone data becomes stale THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent refresh mechanisms
6. WHEN performing bulk operations THEN the system SHALL use debouncing to prevent excessive updates

### Requirement 4: Enhanced User Experience Features

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want additional timezone-related features that make the plugin more useful and informative, so that I can better coordinate with people across different time zones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a user's timezone THEN the system SHALL optionally display the time difference from my timezone
2. WHEN a user sets their timezone THEN the system SHALL optionally show their current date alongside the time
3. WHEN multiple users in a conversation have timezones set THEN the system SHALL provide a summary view of all timezones
4. IF a user frequently interacts with specific timezones THEN the system SHALL remember and prioritize those in the selection menu
5. WHEN displaying times THEN the system SHALL support additional formats like relative time ("2 hours ahead")
6. WHEN a timezone observes daylight saving time THEN the system SHALL indicate this in the display

### Requirement 5: Accessibility and Internationalization

**User Story:** As a Discord user with accessibility needs or using Discord in different languages, I want the timezone plugin to be fully accessible and localized, so that I can use it effectively regardless of my abilities or language preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions for all timezone elements
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard only THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard navigation of timezone menus
3. WHEN displaying in high contrast mode THEN the system SHALL ensure timezone information remains clearly visible
4. IF Discord is set to a non-English language THEN the system SHALL display timezone names and UI text in the appropriate language
5. WHEN timezone information is displayed THEN the system SHALL respect user's locale settings for time formatting
6. WHEN providing error messages THEN the system SHALL support localization for different languages

### Requirement 6: Data Management and Migration

**User Story:** As a Discord user who has been using the timezone plugin, I want my timezone data to be properly managed and migrated when updates occur, so that I don't lose my settings or experience data corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN plugin updates occur THEN the system SHALL migrate existing timezone data to new formats if needed
2. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt to recover from backups or reset gracefully
3. WHEN exporting Discord data THEN the system SHALL include timezone preferences in the export
4. IF a user wants to reset their timezone data THEN the system SHALL provide a clear reset option
5. WHEN storing timezone data THEN the system SHALL implement data validation and integrity checks
6. WHEN multiple Discord instances are used THEN the system SHALL handle data synchronization appropriately

### Requirement 7: Developer Experience and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the timezone plugin, I want comprehensive testing, documentation, and debugging tools, so that I can efficiently maintain and extend the plugin.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing the plugin THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive unit tests for all core functionality
2. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging with configurable log levels
3. WHEN extending functionality THEN the system SHALL have clear interfaces and documentation for new features
4. IF performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL include performance monitoring and profiling capabilities
5. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL include integration tests to verify plugin compatibility
6. WHEN documenting the plugin THEN the system SHALL include examples and usage guidelines for end users
